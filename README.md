with

- [Hibernate](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/)
- [jOOQ](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/)
- [Jdbi](https://github.com/jdbi/jdbi/)
- [Spring JDBC](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/main/spring-jdbc/)
- [Spring Data](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-relational/)
